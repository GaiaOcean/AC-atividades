 R type Instruction

 a R type instruction is a type of mips instruction that has 3 registers, one stores the result of an operation and the others have their values used
 during an operation. Common r type instructions are add, sub and slt  

 I-type (Immediate-type) instructions in MIPS

An I-type instruction in MIPS is used when the operation:

Involves one register and one constant (immediate value)  such as addi

Or involves memory access (like load/store)  sw, lw

Or involves branches (like beq, bne) 

J-type instructions are used for unconditional jumps to a specific address in the program. They don’t work with registers directly — they use a target address instead.
ex: j, jal(for functions)
